## Abstract
Europe is home to a diverse array of cultures, economies, and demographics. Despite this, Europeans also maintain a shared sense of heritage and common values. This duality of diversity and similarity makes this group of countries a distinctive population to be studied. As such, this thesis seeks to identify the dimensions that connect and separate the European population.

To conduct our study, we gathered data from Twitter, since social media platforms have been widely used to shape societal behavior. Our analysis included 6 major European cities and covered a 8-month period to perform topic modeling and natural language processing. Our findings suggest that international topics exhibit similar levels of discourse intensity, while local topics are influenced by both location and the relationship between the city and the subject at hand.

This study not only enhances our comprehension of the European community but also initiates preliminary research toward establishing an empirically valid "European Digital Identity".
